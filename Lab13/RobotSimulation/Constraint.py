# Constraint.py
# Created by Michael Marek (2015)
# Creates a constraint between two particles in the simulation world. Once the constraint is
# created and two points are specified, the constraint attempts to maintain that initial distance
# between the two particles. The constraint is modelled as a spring, and as such, is mathematically
# defined using Hooke's law. If the particle's become too close or two far apart, a force is
# applied to each in order to restore the distance equilibrium. For our purposes, since we model
# the motion of particles using Verlet integration, we directly adjust the impulse of the
# particles to move them, rather than apply a force.

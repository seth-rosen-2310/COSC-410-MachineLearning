# COSC-410-MachineLearning
This is a collection of all the programming assignments for my Machine Learning course taken during my undergrad at Colgate University in the spring of 2022. Of the labs not accounted for, 7 and 11 were used as study sessions for the midterm and final exams respectively while lab 12 was cancelled due to a large portion of the class having issues with one of the required python libraries resulting in the professor scratching that lab. The labs present cover a wide variety of ML topics including shallow models, deep learning, reinforcement learning, NLP with text generation, image processing, and genetic algorithms. These assignments also used a variety of data including standard ML practice datasets, weather data, and even health related data to give the assignments more practical experience. The majority of the data used is included in the file with the respective lab with only a few labs having data larger than the upload limit.

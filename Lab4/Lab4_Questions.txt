4.2) What do these features tell you about the movie rating prediction task? Are you surprised by the ranking of these features? If so, why? If not, why not?

# YOUR ANSWER HERE
These features tell us that the director and production company have the largest impact in predicting a movie rating while duration and year have are less important. These results do not surprise me as some directors and production companies have build up more reputation such that their movies are always rated well. Some directors also consistently make movies that are well rated such as Christopher Nolan. The only surprising feature in the top five is drama but it could just mean that drama movies tend to get more distinct ratings than other movies making it easier to predict the rating.
